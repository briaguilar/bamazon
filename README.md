# Node.js & MySQL
## Overview

As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

This node application is an Amazon-like storefront application that uses the MySQL database. It can take orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.
